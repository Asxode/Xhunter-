About The Project
There are many great Android RAT available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a RAT so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:

The main reason, I did started on this project is to simplify the problem of connection between attacker and victim.[Eliminated all port forwarding and over the internet issues]
Followed by, I wanted to have control over victims using smartphone📱 with a simple UI app rather then a pc💻 or remote virtual machine🖥 with command line interface.
Of course, no one will serve all features since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.😀
